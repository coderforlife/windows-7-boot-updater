To be able to run the compile-x86-net2 command the following need to be installed:
* 7-zip (to be able to compress various resources)
* MS Visual Studio 2008 SP1 C++ Express (for various tools)
* Windows SDK v7.0 and .NET 3.5 SP1
* Windows AIK for Windows 7 (v3.0)
* Microsoft .NET 4.0 Framework

Possibly, but I doubt it:
* MS Visual C++ 2015 Redis x86
* MS Visual C++ 2010 Redis x86
